# Accessibility Program for Users with Injured Hands

I broke a finger on my left hand in late October 2024, which inspired me to create this project. This program allows you to input text on your laptop or desktop computer using your mobile phone and only one hand!. 

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Then, open the following link from your mobile phone:

```
http://<your_PC_IP>:8000
```

With this setup, you can easily type on your desktop even with an injured hand!
